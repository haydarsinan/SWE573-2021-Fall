* They can spend time and earn time as currency in the platform.
* People start with a standart balance for example 5 hour credits to get a service.
* People can add others as a friend.
* In the platform services can be searched with specific filters. People who demand a service send a request to get a service.
* People who give services can admit requests.
* At the end of the service transfer, hours spent during the service will be given as credit to service provider.
* In the platform, people can create events and attend these events.
